    <h3>Quick start</h3>
    
    Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is first cryptographic standard aroused 
    as result of public competition and established by U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology. 
    Standard is composed of three cryptographic algorithms: AES-128, AES-192 and AES-256. 
    Each of them, perceived as a whole makes a huge and complex transformation. 
    However, it comprises of certain number minor and much simpler transformations.
    <br></br>
    
    <h3>Basic transformations</h3>
	Basic AES transformations that are implemented here so far are:
	<li><t:pagelink page="SubBytesPG">SubBytes</t:pagelink></li>
	<li><t:pagelink page="ShiftRowsPG">ShiftRows</t:pagelink></li>
	<li><t:pagelink page="MixColumnsPG">MixColumns</t:pagelink></li>
	<li><t:pagelink page="AddRoundKeyPG">AddRoundKey</t:pagelink></li>
	You can use these transformations as an introduction to AES algorithm in a following way:<br></br>
	At bottom of any of those pages, you can find grid with some predefined test vectors that are 
	taken from FIPS 197 publication, defining the AES algorithm.<br></br>
	You can see those transformations in action when you click on View transformation link in every row.
	Every transformation will take test vector (or vectors) from grid, and give you results on the top of page 
	in a form of the AES State. AES State is rectangular array of bytes, having four rows and 
	(for present time) four columns, that holds results and inter-results of transformations.<br></br>
	When you get familiar with them, you can try to enter your own test vectors, 
	using <t:pagelink page="values/CreateTestValues">Create new values</t:pagelink> page,
	to save them to database and then check out the results of specific transformations.
    <br></br>
    
    <h3>Meta transformation</h3>
	Extraordinary fact about AES is that, when you recognize its comprising parts, 
	algorithm itself is quite simple. On Metatransformation page, you can find predefined 
	metatransformations and test vectors, in two grids at page bottom. When I say predefined meta-transformation, 
	I mean original AES128, AES192 or AES256 algorithm. <p></p>
	Usage:<br></br>
	<li>First, click on Edit/Fill link on Metatransformation source code grid.</li> 
	This action will fill Input area with metatransformation source code.
	<li>Second, select test vector from Metatransformation test value grid, using transform data link.</li>  
	Tip:<br></br>
	At the very beginning, try to combine first metatransformation and first test value, 
	second metatransformation and second test value etc. - they are taken from FIPS 197 publication as pairs.
	<br></br>
	Metatransformations were being made in such a way that hide some details from you, and let you 
	concentrate on core of AES algorithm.<br></br> 
	After a while, you can try experiment with original AES transformation sequence, 
	for example to reorder:<p></p>
	subBytes.transform_state();<br></br>
	shiftRows.transform_state();<br></br>
	mixColumns.transform_state();<p></p>
	into<p></p>
	mixColumns.transform_state();<br></br> 
	subBytes.transform_state();<br></br>
	shiftRows.transform_state();<p></p>
	For present state of this project, you MUST enter key_len and init_key variables in 
	metatransformation source, as in following example:<br></br>
	key_len = 128;<br></br>
    init_key = "2b7e151628aed2a6abf7158809cf4f3c";<p></p>
    Initial key value must be sequence of hex digits, and must obey the following rules:<br></br>

<table border="1" bordercolor="#000000" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="2">
	<tr>
		<td>key_len</td>
		<td>init_key_size</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>128</td>
		<td>16 hex bytes (32 alphanumerics)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>192</td>
		<td>24 hex bytes (48 alphanumerics)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>256</td>
		<td>32 hex bytes (64 alphanumerics)</td>
	</tr>
</table>
<br></br>
Finally, when you are satisfied with results from some of your new algorithms/metatransformations,
you can save them to database using Save new or Update buttons.
