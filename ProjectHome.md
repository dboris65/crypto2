In this project you can examine cryptographic algorithm AES. This code is written using Java.

Here, you can see AES transformations (SubBytes, MixColumns, ShiftRows and KeyExpansion) in action.

After the first phase, when you get familiar with AES transformations, you can try to experiment with AES algorithm, to reorder it's transformations (treat them as META-transformations), in experimental purposes.
